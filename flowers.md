#Flowers<br>
<br>
        _By Madison Julius Cawein_ 


Oh, why for us the blighted bloom!<br>
The *blossom* that lies withering!<br>
The Master of Life's changeless loom<br>
_Hath wrought for us no changeless thing._<br>

Where grows the rose of fadeless Grace?<br>
Wherethrough the Spirit manifests<br>
_The fact of an immortal race,_<br>
_The dream on which religion rests._<br>

Where buds the lily of our Faith?<br>
That grows for us in unknown wise,<br>
Out of the barren dust of death,<br>
_The pregnant bloom of Paradise._<br>

In Heaven! so near _that flowers know!_<br>
That flowers see how near! - and thus<br>
Reflect the knowledge here below<br>
_Of love and life unknown to us._<br>
